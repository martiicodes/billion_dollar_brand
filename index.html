      Dear friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      Trust me, I get it...
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're like me...<br>
      I know how it is to be bullied<br>
      by the environment that tries to box you in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Building a business is hard.</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
      You're probably uncertain when and where<br>
      your next customer will come from.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's real damn hard and it can feel awful sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's super-hard to position your business in this bloody,<br>
      crowded, shark-infested waters we call a marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sounds familiar?
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand how is it to be invisible as a business.<br>
      I feel your pain because I know frustration and stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been there too. Many, many times.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You're probably being pulled by a lots of different forces.</li>
      <li>You're probably sick and tired of uncertainty.</li>
      <li>You're probably feeling stress right now.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I know many of my clients do...
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Yet, business is a game destined for<br>
      an elite club of creative rebels.</strong>

      Steve Jobs?</br>

    <p>
      We all thrive in deep waters of uncertainty.<br>
      ‚ÄãThose guys know that‚Äôs where the <u>treasure</u> hides.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are trail-blazers.</br>
      We are a selected few.</br>
      We are a special breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>And we have an unique value to share.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that's why I believe that<br>

      everyone should be seen and heard.

    <ul>
      <li>Your business is a natural reflection of you.</li>
      <li>Your business is a story of your life.</li>
      <li>Your business is an epic journey.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now you may wonder: <i>"What should I do next?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't worry.<br> 
      I have a solution for you.

      I'm gonna share a secret with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years, I struggled to transform brands<br> 
      into top-of-the-line <u>money-making machines.</u>
    </p>
    <p>
      And my journey begins after many failed attempts<br> 
      to build successful businesses for my clients and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those hard times taught me that <u>knowledge is power.</u>
    </p>
    <p>  
      This is exactly what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkest, deepest moments of desperation,<br>
      I was defeated, dead-broke, and depressed...
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>This was a full-blown descent into darkness.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point...<br>
      I decided I needed to change.
